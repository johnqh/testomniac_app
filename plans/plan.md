# Web App Discovery, AI Exploration, and Test Automation System
## Integrated Design Specification

**Date:** April 19, 2026
**Status:** Approved design

---

# 1. Purpose

A Node.js system that discovers UI elements on web applications through action-driven scanning, augments discovery with AI-generated personas and use cases, generates JSON test sequences, and executes them via Puppeteer. Scanning is deterministic and exhaustive; AI is used to understand the site and generate meaningful input data, not to drive navigation.

---

# 2. Goals

1. Action-driven scanning: discover all pages and page states via mouseover → click traversal
2. Extract actionable UI items with screen position, attributes, accessibility info
3. AI-generated personas and use cases to drive form input values
4. Pairwise testing of discrete control combinations (checkbox, toggle, select)
5. Generate JSON action sequence tests via templates
6. Execute tests with a custom Puppeteer runner
7. Capture console logs, network logs, screenshots
8. Detect page state changes via HTML hashing
9. Persist all data in normalized PostgreSQL
10. Email test reports with deep link session rehydration
11. Scan per SizeClass (desktop + mobile); test cases specify which to run

---

# 3. Non-Goals

- CAPTCHA bypass
- MFA beyond single 2FA code entry (e.g., hardware keys, push notifications)
- Multi-browser support
- Distributed crawling
- Advanced visual diffing
- AI-generated test code (templates only)
- Cloud browser services (local Chromium only)
- Exhaustive control combinations (pairwise only)
- Iframe content scanning (payment forms, embedded widgets)
- Shadow DOM traversal

**Data flow for a scan:**
1. User fills Start Scan form in frontend
2. Frontend calls `testomniac_api` → inserts `runs` row (status: `pending`) with encrypted credentials
3. Scanner polls DB, picks up pending run, sets status: `running`
4. Scanner emits progress via `NOTIFY run_events` on PostgreSQL
5. API's SSE endpoint `LISTEN`s on `run_events` channel, streams to frontend
6. Scanner completes → sets status: `completed`
7. Frontend shows results by querying API

# 6. Core Concepts

| Concept | Definition |
|---------|-----------|
| Project | A container belonging to an entity (from entity_service). An entity can have multiple Projects. Each Project has one App |
| App | Target web application (URL + name). Belongs to a Project |
| Page | A distinct route, identified by URL |
| Page State | A specific DOM state within a Page. One Page can have multiple Page States (e.g., menu open vs. closed). Detected via HTML change hashing |
| Action | A user interaction (navigate, mouseover, click, fill, select, check, toggle, check_email). Has a starting Page State and a target Page + Page State (both optional). Tracks its own duration |
| Persona | A type of user of the web app. Every app has at least one. Created by AI after mouse-only scanning |
| Use Case | A specific user goal belonging to a Persona (e.g., "Purchase a product"). AI creates these and generates input values for each |
| SizeClass | Enum: `desktop` \| `mobile`. Scanner runs once per SizeClass |
| Screen | Enum of common resolutions within a SizeClass (e.g., 1920x1080, 1366x768 for desktop; 390x844, 360x800 for mobile). Test cases run across Screens |
| Component | A reusable UI region (nav bar, footer, sidebar) detected across multiple pages. Identical HTML hash = same component, tested once. Variations tested separately |
| Test Case | An ordered sequence of one or more Actions forming a testable scenario |
| Test Run | An individual execution of a Test Case. Created by the runner. Navigates from the nearest starting point, replays the action chain, detects issues, tracks duration |
| Issue | A problem detected during scanning or test execution: dead click, error on page, console error, or network error. Linked to the triggering Action and optionally to a Test Run. Contains reproduction steps |
| Run | A full session (scanning → test generation → test execution). Tracks wall-clock and per-phase durations |

# 7. Functional Requirements

## 7.1 Authentication

### Login Detection

Pages requiring login are detected via:
- HTTP redirect to `/login`, `/signin`, `/auth` (or similar)
- HTTP 401/403 response

### Form Identification

The scanner identifies sign-up and login forms using heuristics (both applied, either sufficient):

**URL/text matching:** Forms on pages with URLs or visible text containing "signup", "sign up", "register", "create account", "join", "get started" → sign-up form. URLs/text containing "login", "log in", "signin", "sign in" → login form.

**Field pattern matching:**
- Sign-up form: has "name"/"first name" + "email" + "password" + optional "confirm password"
- Login form: has only "email"/"username" + "password" (2 fields, no name field)
- Contact/other form: has "message"/"subject" or lacks password field → not auth

### Two Credential Modes

**Mode A: User-Provided Credentials**

The tester provides:
- Email or username
- Password
- 2FA code (optional)

The scanner uses these to log in via the identified login form:
1. Navigate to login page
2. Fill email/username and password fields
3. Submit form
4. If 2FA prompt detected (input field after login submit, typically with "code", "verification", "2FA", "authenticator" labels): fill the provided 2FA code
5. Verify login succeeded (no redirect back to login, no error on page)
6. Proceed with authenticated scanning

**Mode B: Signic Auto-Registration (No Credentials Provided)**

When no credentials are provided, the scanner creates an account automatically using the Signic SDK:

1. Generate a random Ethereum private key
2. Create a `SignicClient` → derive email address (`0x...@signic.email`)
3. Generate a test password (e.g., `TestPass!${randomHex(8)}`)
4. Find the sign-up form (identified in Phase 1a via heuristics)
5. Fill the form: name = "Test User", email = Signic email, password = generated password
6. Submit the form
7. Poll Signic inbox (`client.getUnreadEmails()`) for verification email
8. Extract OTP code or verification link from email body (`client.getEmail()`)
9. If OTP: find the verification input field, fill it, submit
10. If link: navigate to the verification URL
11. Verify account creation succeeded
12. Store the credentials (Signic email + password) for use in Phase 2 login

If the site rejects the Signic email format or sign-up fails, skip authenticated scanning and log the issue.

### Password Requirement Testing (Sign-Up Screens)

When a sign-up form is identified, the scanner detects password requirements from visible text on the page (e.g., "Password must be at least 8 characters", "Must contain uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character", "No spaces allowed").

**Detection:** Text pattern matching on visible page text for common password rule phrases:
- Length: "at least N characters", "minimum N characters", "N+ characters"
- Uppercase: "uppercase", "capital letter"
- Lowercase: "lowercase"
- Number/digit: "number", "digit"
- Special character: "special character", "symbol", "!@#$"
- No spaces: "no spaces"

**Test generation:** Based on detected requirements, the scanner generates password test cases:

1. **Fail cases first** — one test per requirement violation:
   - Too short (if min length detected)
   - No uppercase (if uppercase required)
   - No lowercase (if lowercase required)
   - No number (if number required)
   - No special character (if special char required)
   - Contains spaces (if no-spaces rule detected)
   Each fail case fills the sign-up form, submits, and asserts that the form shows a validation error or does not proceed.

2. **Pass case last** — a password satisfying all detected requirements:
   - Fill the sign-up form with a valid password, submit, assert success.

These test cases are created during Phase 1c (Input Scanning) when processing sign-up forms. Each becomes a test case linked to the sign-up page.

### Session Persistence

- Persistent Chromium profile via `user-data-dir`
- Login session preserved across scanning phases
- If session expires mid-scan, re-authenticate using stored credentials

## 7.2 Phase 1a: Mouse-Only Scanning (Public)

Discovers all publicly reachable Pages and Page States using only navigate, mouseover, and click. No text input, no form submission.

**Action queue algorithm:**

The scanner maintains a queue of open Actions. It always picks the next open Action, executes it, records the result, and creates new Actions from what it discovers. Scanning ends when no open Actions remain.

**Step 1 — Seed the queue:**

Create an initial `navigate` Action:
- `startingPageState`: null
- `targetPage`: base URL Page
- `targetPageState`: null (to be filled)
- `status`: open

**Step 2 — Process loop:**

```
while (open mouse actions exist):
  pick next open action

  if action's startingPageState != current browser state:
    find nearest navigate action to reach the right state
    execute that navigation first

  execute the action:

    case NAVIGATE:
      load the URL
      parse HTML → create target Page State
      scan page → extract all interactive elements
      create MOUSEOVER Action for each element:
        startingPageState = this navigate's targetPageState
      mark navigate as completed

    case MOUSEOVER:
      simulate mouse hover on element
      if HTML changed:
        create new Page State as targetPageState
        scan new state → create MOUSEOVER Actions for newly visible elements
      else:
        targetPageState = startingPageState
      create a CLICK Action:
        startingPageState = this mouseover's targetPageState
      mark mouseover as completed

    case CLICK:
      simulate click
      if URL changed:
        targetPage = new or existing Page
        parse HTML → targetPageState = new or existing Page State
        if new Page State:
          scan → create MOUSEOVER Actions for elements
      else (same URL):
        if HTML changed:
          targetPageState = new Page State
          scan → create MOUSEOVER Actions for new elements
        else:
          targetPageState = startingPageState
      mark click as completed

  deduplication:
    if targetPage + targetPageState already fully covered:
      don't create new Actions from it
```

**Element discovery** — runs as `page.evaluate()` on each new Page State:

Selectors:
```
a[href], button, input:not([type="hidden"]), select, textarea, summary,
[role="button"], [role="link"], [role="checkbox"], [role="radio"],
[role="switch"], [role="tab"], [role="menuitem"], [role="textbox"],
[role="combobox"], [tabindex]:not([tabindex="-1"]), [contenteditable="true"]
```

Captured per element:
```ts
type ActionableItem = {
  stableKey: string
  selector: string
  tagName: string
  role?: string
  inputType?: string
  actionKind: 'click' | 'fill' | 'toggle' | 'select' | 'navigate'
  accessibleName?: string
  textContent?: string
  href?: string
  disabled: boolean
  visible: boolean
  x?: number
  y?: number
  width?: number
  height?: number
  attributes: Record<string, unknown>
}
```

**What this phase skips:**
- Elements requiring text input (`input[type=text]`, `textarea`, etc.) — deferred to Phase 1c
- Form submit buttons — deferred until inputs are filled in Phase 1c

**What this phase produces:**
- All publicly reachable Pages and Page States
- Full actionable item inventory per Page State
- Page State hashes for change detection
- Screenshots and console/network logs per Page State

## 7.3 Phase 1a.5: Reusable Component Detection

After mouse-only scanning discovers all pages and page states, detect reusable components (nav bars, footers, sidebars) to avoid duplicate testing.

### Detection Algorithm

1. **Extract candidate regions** from each Page State's HTML using structural selectors:
   - `<nav>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`
   - `[role="navigation"]`, `[role="banner"]`, `[role="contentinfo"]`
   - Elements with IDs/classes matching common patterns: `navbar`, `sidebar`, `menu`, `footer`, `header`, `top-bar`, `bottom-bar`

2. **Normalize and hash** each candidate's inner HTML (strip whitespace, sort attributes — same normalization as page state hashing)

3. **Group by hash** across all Page States:
   - Same hash on 2+ pages → reusable component. Create a `components` row with one `canonical_page_state_id` (the first page state where it appeared)
   - Create `component_instances` rows for each occurrence, marking `is_identical = true`

4. **Detect variations**: If a candidate region (same selector, e.g., `<nav>`) appears on multiple pages but with different hashes:
   - Each unique hash gets its own `components` row
   - Instances with a different hash from the canonical are marked `is_identical = false`
   - Example: a nav bar that adds an "active" class on the current page → different hash → tested separately

### Impact on Scanning and Testing

**During Phase 1a (mouse scanning):**
- All elements on all pages are still scanned — component detection doesn't skip scanning
- Component detection runs after Phase 1a completes, before Phase 1b

**During test generation (Phase 3):**
- For identical component instances (`is_identical = true`): generate test actions only for the canonical page state. Skip generating mouseover/click actions for the same elements on other pages
- For non-identical instances (`is_identical = false`): generate test actions for each unique variation
- Navigation and E2E tests still traverse through pages with components — only the component-internal actions (e.g., clicking each nav link) are deduplicated

**Example:**
- Footer appears identically on 20 pages → 1 render test for footer elements (on canonical page), not 20
- Header nav appears on 20 pages but has "active" state variations on 3 pages → 1 canonical test + 3 variation tests

### Hamburger Menu Handling

On mobile SizeClass, the scanner detects hamburger menus via:
- Buttons with `aria-label` matching "menu", "hamburger", "toggle navigation"
- Elements with `role="button"` that toggle `aria-expanded`
- Elements containing the typical hamburger icon (three-line pattern)

The hamburger menu and its expanded content are treated as a component. If the expanded menu HTML is identical across pages, it's tested once.

## 7.4 Phase 1b: AI Analysis

After mouse-only scanning completes, send all page content to OpenAI:

1. **Site summary** — what the website does, its domain, key features
2. **Personas** — types of users the site serves (e.g., "Shopper", "Blog Reader", "Admin"). Every app gets at least one Persona
3. **Use Cases** per Persona — specific user goals (e.g., Shopper: "Search for a product", "Add to cart", "Complete checkout")
4. **Input values** per Use Case — for each form field encountered, AI generates appropriate values tied to the Persona + Use Case context (e.g., for Shopper "Sign up": name = "Jane Smith", email = "jane@example.com")

Personas, Use Cases, and input values are persisted to the DB for use in Phase 1c and test generation.

## 7.5 Phase 1c: Input Scanning (Public)

Process all deferred input actions, informed by Personas and Use Cases.

### Text inputs

For each form with text fields, for each Persona with a relevant Use Case:
- Create `fill` Actions with AI-generated input values for that Persona + Use Case
- Create a `click` Action on the submit button
- Execute → record resulting Page + Page State
- If new Page State → scan for new elements and create Actions

Each Persona gets its own separate set of fill + submit Actions, even on shared forms.

### Discrete controls (pairwise testing)

| Control | States |
|---------|--------|
| Checkbox | checked / unchecked |
| Toggle | on / off |
| Select/dropdown | each option value |
| Radio group | each option |

For forms with multiple discrete controls, use **pairwise testing** (all 2-way combinations) instead of exhaustive combinations:
- Generates far fewer test cases (e.g., 5 checkboxes + 2 selects with 4 options: ~20 pairwise vs. 512 exhaustive)
- Covers all interactions between any two controls
- Each pairwise combination becomes a separate Action sequence (fill/check/select/toggle + submit)
- Each result is a potential new Page State

```
for each form:
  generate pairwise combinations of control values
  for each combination:
    for each Persona with a relevant Use Case:
      create fill/check/select/toggle Actions (with Persona's text input values)
      create submit Action
      execute → record resulting Page + Page State
      if new state → scan for new Actions
```

## 7.6 Phase 1d: Re-Verify Public Pages

After Phases 1a-1c complete, re-verify all public pages to detect login requirements. During earlier phases, some pages may not have been tested for auth (they were reached via click, not direct navigation).

1. Review all discovered Pages
2. For each page, attempt a fresh `navigate` (direct URL load)
3. If the response redirects to an auth page or returns 401/403: mark `requires_login = true`
4. If the page loads normally: compare hashes against the most recent Page State to detect any content changes since initial scan
5. This categorizes all pages into public vs. login-required, which drives Phase 2

## 7.7 Phase 2: Login-Required Scanning

After public scanning + re-verification:

1. **Authenticate:**
   - If user-provided credentials: use login-executor to fill the login form, handle 2FA if needed
   - If no credentials: use signic-registrar to auto-register (see Section 7.1 Mode B), then log in with the generated credentials
2. **Scan authenticated pages:**
   - Create `navigate` Actions to all pages that returned 401/403 or redirected to auth
   - Run the same process loop (Phase 1a algorithm) for authenticated pages
   - Then run Phase 1c (input scanning) for authenticated forms using Persona Use Cases
3. New authenticated Pages, Page States, and Actions are discovered and persisted
4. If session expires mid-scan, re-authenticate using stored credentials and resume

## 7.8 State Management

The scanner tracks the current browser state (current Page + Page State). When picking the next open Action:

- If the Action's `startingPageState` matches the current browser state → execute directly
- If not → restore the required state using the **action chain**:
  1. Each Page State records `created_by_action_id` — the action that first produced this state
  2. Walk backward from the target Page State via `created_by_action_id` to find the nearest `navigate` action
  3. Execute the navigate action (load the URL)
  4. Replay the mouseover chain in order to reach the target Page State
  5. This chain is typically: navigate → mouseover (produces intermediate state) → mouseover (produces target state)

## 7.9 SizeClass Scanning

The full scanning process (Phases 1a through 2) runs **once per SizeClass**:

1. **Desktop scan** — full viewport (e.g., 1920x1080)
2. **Mobile scan** — mobile viewport (e.g., 390x844)

Each may discover different elements (hamburger menus, mobile nav, responsive layouts). Pages, Page States, and Actions are tagged with their SizeClass.

Test cases specify which SizeClass they belong to. During test execution, the runner selects which SizeClass and Screen resolutions to test.

## 7.10 Issue Detection

Issues are created automatically during scanning when the scanner detects problems. All issues are severity `error` (warning-level issues are a future addition).

### Issue Types

| Issue Type | Trigger | Detection |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| `dead_click` | A click action's ending Page State is the same as its starting Page State | Compare `target_page_state_id` == `starting_page_state_id` after click execution. The click didn't navigate or change anything |
| `error_on_page` | The ending Page State contains an error message | Text pattern matching (visible text containing "error", "failed", "something went wrong", "not found", "500", "404", "oops", "unexpected", etc.) + HTML pattern matching (elements with `role="alert"`, `.error`, `.alert-danger`, `.alert-error`, `[data-error]`, `.error-message`, `.toast-error`) |
| `console_error` | Console error logged during an action | Capture all `console.error` calls during action execution. Filter out known noise: favicon 404s, third-party script errors (different domain), deprecated API warnings |
| `network_error` | Network request failure during an action | Same-domain requests with status >= 400, OR any domain with status >= 500. Ignore third-party 4xx (analytics, tracking, ads) |
| `email_not_received` | `check_email` action timed out waiting for email | Signic inbox polled for 60s with no matching email |

### Issue Content

Each issue contains:
- **Reproduction steps**: The full action chain from the initial `navigate` action to the action that triggered the issue. This is the minimal path to reproduce
- **Description**: Human-readable text describing what happened (e.g., "Click on 'Submit' button did not navigate or change page state", "Page shows error message: 'Something went wrong'", "POST /api/orders returned 500")
- **Console log**: Full console output captured during the triggering action
- **Network log**: All network requests/responses during the triggering action
- **Screenshot**: Screenshot of the page at the time of the issue

### When Issues Are Created

Issues are detected and created in real-time during scanning (all phases):
- After every `click` action: check for `dead_click`
- After every action: check ending Page State for `error_on_page`
- After every action: check console buffer for `console_error`
- After every action: check network log for `network_error`

A single action can produce multiple issues (e.g., a click that returns a 500 AND shows an error message AND logs a console error = 3 separate issues, all sharing the same reproduction steps).

## 7.11 Email Detection and Checking

The scanner detects when an action will trigger an email, and automatically creates a `check_email` action to verify it arrives and act on its content.

### Detection: Two Cases

**Case 1: Public page with email input**

Before form submission, detect:
- The form contains an email input field
- Visible text on the page matches email-hint patterns: "we'll send you", "check your email", "verification email", "confirm your email", "we'll email you", "you'll receive an email", "enter your email to receive"

After form submission, confirm:
- Visible text matches confirmation patterns: "email sent", "check your inbox", "we've sent", "verification link sent", "please check your email", "confirmation email"

**Case 2: Logged-in action triggering email**

After a click or form submission in an authenticated session:
- Visible text matches the same confirmation patterns as Case 1
- Applies to any action, not just form submissions (e.g., clicking "Resend verification", "Send invoice", "Reset password")

### check_email Action

When email detection triggers (either case), the scanner creates a `check_email` action:
- `startingPageState`: the current Page State (after submission)
- Uses the Signic SDK to poll the inbox
- Waits up to 60 seconds for the email to arrive (poll every 2 seconds)
- Records whether the email arrived (creates an issue of type `email_not_received` if it doesn't)

**Signic client sharing:** When Signic auto-registration is used (Mode B), the Signic client and private key are stored in the `credential_manager`. Both the scanner and the test runner access the same client via the credential manager, ensuring they poll the same inbox. For test execution, the runner re-creates the Signic client from the stored private key if a `check_email` action is encountered.

### Acting on Email Content

When an email arrives, the scanner examines its content:

1. **OTP code found** (4-8 digit number): 
   - Find an input field on the current page matching OTP selectors (`input[name*="code"]`, `input[name*="otp"]`, `input[name*="verification"]`, etc.)
   - Create a `fill` action with the OTP value
   - Create a `click` action on the submit button

2. **Verification/action link found** (URL containing "verify", "confirm", "activate", "reset"):
   - Create a `navigate` action to the link URL
   - After navigation, capture the resulting Page State

3. **Neither found**:
   - Record that the email was received but contained no actionable content
   - No further actions created

### Issue Type for Email

| Issue Type | Trigger | Detection |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| `email_not_received` | `check_email` action timed out waiting for email | Signic inbox polled for 60s with no matching email |

## 7.12 JavaScript Dialog Handling

The scanner auto-handles JavaScript dialogs to prevent blocking:
- `alert()` → auto-dismiss
- `confirm()` → auto-accept (click OK)
- `prompt()` → auto-dismiss with empty string
- `beforeunload` → auto-accept (allow navigation)

Puppeteer's `page.on('dialog')` handler is registered at page creation. All dialogs are logged in the action's console log.

## 7.13 Scroll Handling

Puppeteer's `el.hover()` and `el.click()` auto-scroll elements into view. The scanner does not need explicit scroll actions during discovery. However, some elements may only appear after scrolling (lazy-loaded content). After initial page state extraction, the scanner scrolls to bottom in increments, checking for new elements at each step. New elements found after scroll create additional mouseover actions.

## 7.14 Infinite Loop Protection

The scanning algorithm can encounter cycles (Page State A → click → Page State B → click → Page State A). Protection mechanisms:

- **Action signature deduplication**: Before creating an action, compute a signature (`type + actionable_item_id + starting_page_state_id`). If this signature already exists for the current run, skip creation.
- **Max actions per page state**: No more than 200 actions can originate from a single Page State. Beyond this, log a warning and stop creating new actions for that state.
- **Max total actions per run**: Default 5000. Configurable. Scanner stops when reached.
- **Max pages per run**: Default 100. Configurable.

## 7.15 Page Change Detection

| Hash | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| HTML hash | Coarse full-page change |
| Normalized HTML hash | Structural change (whitespace/attribute-order normalized) |
| Text hash | Visible content change |
| Actionable hash | Interaction surface change |

A new Page State is created if ANY hash differs from the current state. URL change creates a new Page.

## 7.16 Artifact Capture

Per Page State (during scanning):
- Screenshot (JPEG, quality 72)
- Console log buffer (errors, warnings)
- Network log buffer (API calls: method, URL, status, content-type)
- Raw HTML snapshot

Per test execution:
- Screenshot on failure
- Console errors during execution

All artifacts stored to filesystem, paths recorded in DB.

**Directory structure:**
```
artifacts/
  {run_id}/
    pages/
      {page_id}/
        {page_state_id}/
          screenshot.jpg
          raw.html
    test_runs/
      {test_run_id}/
        failure.jpg
    logs/
      console.log
      network.log
```

# 8. Test Case Generation (Phase 3)

Test cases are generated from the scanning data. Template-based, no AI. Each test case is a JSON action sequence.

## Generation Rules

| Scanning Pattern | Test Case |
|-----------------|-----------|
| `navigate` | Own test case: navigate to page, assert it loads |
| `mouseover` → `click` | Grouped into one test case |
| `mouseover` → `mouseover` → `click` (menu drill-down) | All grouped into one test case |
| `fill` (multiple fields) → `submit` | One test case per Persona + Use Case (positive) |
| Required fields empty → `submit` | One negative test case per form: leave each required field empty, assert validation error |
| Invalid format → `submit` | One negative test per field type: invalid email, too-short text, etc. |
| Pairwise control combinations → `submit` | One test case per pairwise combination per Persona |
| Password fail case → `submit` | One test per requirement violation on sign-up forms (too short, no uppercase, etc.) |
| Password pass case → `submit` | One test with valid password on sign-up forms |

Each Persona gets separate test cases even on shared forms.

## Test Types

### Render tests
For each Page State: navigate (+ any mouseover chain to reach the state), assert key elements visible.

```json
{
  "name": "Render — Homepage",
  "type": "render",
  "sizeClass": "desktop",
  "suite_tags": ["regression", "sanity"],
  "page_id": 1,
  "actions": [
    { "action": "navigate", "url": "https://example.com" },
    { "action": "waitForLoad" },
    { "action": "assertVisible", "selector": "[role='button'][name='Sign Up']" },
    { "action": "assertVisible", "selector": "a[href='/pricing']" },
    { "action": "screenshot", "label": "homepage-rendered" }
  ]
}
```

### Mouseover + Click tests

  "suite_tags": ["regression"],
  "actions": [
    { "action": "navigate", "url": "https://example.com/signup" },
    { "action": "fill", "selector": "[name='email']", "value": "test@example.com" },
    { "action": "fill", "selector": "[name='password']", "value": "Ab1!" },
    { "action": "click", "selector": "button[type='submit']" },
    { "action": "assertUrl", "pattern": "/signup", "_comment": "should stay on signup" }
  ]
}
```

### Navigation tests
For each page-to-page transition discovered during scanning.

```json
{
  "name": "Navigation — Home → Pricing",
  "type": "navigation",
  "sizeClass": "desktop",
  "suite_tags": ["regression", "sanity"],
  "actions": [
    { "action": "navigate", "url": "https://example.com" },
    { "action": "waitForLoad" },
    { "action": "click", "selector": "a[href='/pricing']" },
    { "action": "waitForNavigation" },
    { "action": "assertUrl", "pattern": "/pricing" }
  ]
}
```

### E2E tests
Multi-hop journeys via DFS path enumeration (acyclic paths, length >= 3, max depth 6, max 20 paths).

```json
{
  "name": "E2E — Home → Pricing → Sign Up",
  "type": "e2e",
  "sizeClass": "desktop",
  "suite_tags": ["regression", "sanity", "smoke"],
  "actions": [
    { "action": "navigate", "url": "https://example.com" },
    { "action": "step", "label": "Step 1: Home → Pricing" },
    { "action": "click", "selector": "a[href='/pricing']" },
    { "action": "assertUrl", "pattern": "/pricing" },
    { "action": "step", "label": "Step 2: Pricing → Sign Up" },
    { "action": "click", "selector": "a[href='/signup']" },
    { "action": "assertUrl", "pattern": "/signup" }
  ]
}
```

## Action Vocabulary

| Action | Parameters | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| `navigate` | `url` | Go to URL |
| `waitForLoad` | | Wait for networkidle |
| `waitForNavigation` | | Wait after click triggers navigation |
| `mouseover` | `selector` | Hover over element |
| `click` | `selector` | Click element |
| `fill` | `selector`, `value` | Type into input |
| `select` | `selector`, `value` | Select dropdown option |
| `check` | `selector`, `value` (true/false) | Set checkbox state |
| `toggle` | `selector`, `value` (true/false) | Set toggle state |
| `scroll` | `direction`, `amount` | Scroll page |
| `screenshot` | `label` | Capture screenshot |
| `assertVisible` | `selector` | Assert element visible |
| `assertNotVisible` | `selector` | Assert element hidden |
| `assertUrl` | `pattern` | Assert URL matches pattern |
| `assertUrlChanged` | | Assert URL differs from start |
| `assertText` | `selector`, `text` | Assert element contains text |
| `check_email` | `timeout` | Poll Signic inbox for email, act on OTP/link if found |
| `step` | `label` | Label for grouping (E2E) |

## Suite Tag Assignment

- All tests get `regression`
- High-priority render tests get `sanity` + `smoke`
- High-priority form tests get `sanity`
- Navigation tests get `sanity`
- E2E tests get `sanity` + `smoke`

**Priority heuristics:** URLs/titles containing login, signin, signup, register, checkout, payment, cart, settings, admin, dashboard, account, profile, auth → `high`.

# 9. Test Execution (Phase 4)

Custom runner interprets JSON action sequences using Puppeteer. Each execution of a Test Case creates a **Test Run** record.

1. Read `test_cases` from DB, optionally filter by `suite_tags`, `sizeClass`, `persona_id`
2. For each selected Screen resolution within the SizeClass: set viewport size
3. Execute via worker pool (default 3 workers, configurable)
4. Per test case per screen:
   - Create a `test_runs` row with `status: running` and `started_at: now()`
   - Fresh page in shared Chromium instance, set viewport to Screen resolution
   - Navigate to the nearest starting point (the first `navigate` action in the test case)
   - Iterate actions, execute via Puppeteer mapping
   - After each action: check for issues (error on page, console errors, network errors)
   - If issue detected: create `issues` row linked to the `test_run_id`
   - On assertion failure: mark Test Run `failed`, capture screenshot + error
   - On success: mark Test Run `passed`
   - Record duration, screenshot path, console log, network log on the Test Run
   - Set `completed_at: now()` and compute `duration_ms`
5. 1 automatic retry on failure before final `failed` status
6. Timeouts: 30s per test case, 10s per individual action
7. Per-phase duration tracked: total time for all Test Runs recorded as `test_execution_duration_ms` on the Run

**Action-to-Puppeteer mapping:**

```
navigate         → page.goto(url, { waitUntil: 'networkidle0' })
waitForLoad      → page.waitForNavigation({ waitUntil: 'networkidle0' })
waitForNavigation → page.waitForNavigation({ waitUntil: 'networkidle0' })
mouseover        → page.waitForSelector(selector) → el.hover()
click            → page.waitForSelector(selector) → el.click()
fill             → page.waitForSelector(selector) → el.type(value)
select           → page.select(selector, value)
check            → page.waitForSelector(selector) → set checked state
toggle           → page.waitForSelector(selector) → el.click()
scroll           → page.evaluate(window.scrollBy)
screenshot       → page.screenshot({ path })
assertVisible    → page.waitForSelector(selector, { visible: true, timeout: 5000 })
assertNotVisible → page.waitForSelector(selector, { hidden: true, timeout: 5000 })
assertUrl        → check page.url() matches pattern
assertUrlChanged → check page.url() !== startUrl
assertText       → el.textContent includes text
check_email      → poll Signic inbox (2s intervals, 60s timeout), extract OTP/link, act
step             → no-op, label in results
```

# 10. Email Reporting

After test execution:
1. Compute summary: total, passed, failed, skipped, duration
2. Generate signed deep link token (jose, contains run_id)
3. Build HTML + plain text email
4. Send via Postmark
5. Record in `report_emails` table

- Expand → list of use cases for this persona
- Each use case shows: name, description, generated input values per form field

## 13.3 SSE Real-Time Architecture

**Scanner service → PostgreSQL → API → Frontend:**

1. Scanner calls `NOTIFY run_events, '{"run_id":1,"event":"page_discovered","data":{...}}'` after each significant action
2. API's SSE endpoint establishes a `LISTEN run_events` connection to PostgreSQL
3. When notification arrives, API filters by `run_id` (from the SSE URL parameter) and sends matching events to the connected client
4. Frontend renders events in real-time (Scan Progress page)

**Event types:**

| Event | Data | Phase |
|-------|------|-------|
| `phase_changed` | `{ phase, runId }` | Any |
| `page_discovered` | `{ url, name, pageId }` | Mouse scanning |
| `page_state_created` | `{ pageId, stateId, trigger }` | Mouse scanning |
| `action_completed` | `{ type, selector, pageChanged, durationMs }` | Mouse scanning |
| `issue_detected` | `{ type, severity, description, pageUrl }` | Any |
| `component_detected` | `{ name, selector, instanceCount }` | Component detection |
| `ai_persona_created` | `{ name, description }` | AI analysis |
| `ai_use_case_created` | `{ personaName, name }` | AI analysis |
| `test_case_generated` | `{ name, type, persona }` | Test generation |
| `test_run_started` | `{ testRunId, testCaseName, screen }` | Test execution |
| `test_run_completed` | `{ testRunId, status, durationMs }` | Test execution |
| `plugin_started` | `{ pluginName }` | Plugins |
| `plugin_issue` | `{ pluginName, type, description }` | Plugins |
| `stats_update` | `{ pages, pageStates, actionsCompleted, actionsRemaining, issues }` | Any |
| `run_complete` | `{ status, totalDurationMs }` | Final |

**Mobile SSE:** React Native uses `react-native-sse` or a fetch-based SSE polyfill. Same event format.

## 13.4 Credential Handling in Frontend

Credentials entered on the Start Scan form are:
1. Sent to `testomniac_api` via HTTPS POST
2. API encrypts using AES-256-GCM with a server-side key (from env var `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY`)
3. Stored in `scan_credentials` table (separate from `runs`)
4. Scanner decrypts when picking up the run
5. Credentials are deleted from DB after the scan completes (or after 24h TTL)
6. Frontend never stores credentials locally

# 16. Plugin Architecture

Add-on checks run as opt-in plugins. The user specifies which plugins to enable when starting a scan (e.g., `plugins: ["seo", "security"]`). Plugins execute after scanning completes (after Phase 2) and before test generation (Phase 3). Each plugin analyzes the discovered pages and page states and produces issues.

## Plugin Interface

```ts
interface Plugin {
  name: string;                    // e.g., "seo", "security"
  description: string;
  // Called once after scanning, receives all discovered data
  analyze(context: PluginContext): Promise<PluginResult>;
}

interface PluginContext {
  appId: number;
  runId: number;
  baseUrl: string;
  pages: Page[];                   // all discovered pages
  pageStates: PageState[];         // all states with HTML content
  networkLogs: NetworkLogEntry[];  // all captured network traffic
  forms: FormInfo[];               // all discovered forms
  db: DrizzleDb;                   // for persisting results
  openai?: OpenAI;                 // available if AI is needed
  browser: Page;                   // Puppeteer page for live checks
}

interface PluginResult {
  issues: PluginIssue[];
  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>;  // plugin-specific data stored on run
}

interface PluginIssue {
  type: string;                    // e.g., "seo_missing_title", "security_missing_csp"
  severity: 'error' | 'warning' | 'info';
  description: string;
  pageUrl: string;
  details?: Record<string, unknown>;
}
```

## Plugin Registration

```ts
// src/plugins/registry.ts
const PLUGINS: Record<string, Plugin> = {};

export function registerPlugin(plugin: Plugin): void {
  PLUGINS[plugin.name] = plugin;
}

export function getPlugin(name: string): Plugin | undefined {
  return PLUGINS[name];
}

export function getEnabledPlugins(names: string[]): Plugin[] {
  return names.map((n) => PLUGINS[n]).filter(Boolean);
}
```

Plugins self-register on import:
```ts
// src/plugins/seo/index.ts
import { registerPlugin } from '../registry.js';
registerPlugin({ name: 'seo', description: '...', analyze: ... });
```

## Plugin Execution in Orchestrator

After Phase 2 (scanning) and before Phase 3 (test generation):
```
Phase 1a-1d: Scanning
Phase 2: Auth scanning
→ Plugin phase: run each enabled plugin's analyze()
  → Issues stored in issues table with plugin name as type prefix
Phase 3: Test generation
Phase 4: Test execution
```

## Plugin Issue Storage

Plugin issues are stored in the same `issues` table with the `type` field prefixed by the plugin name (e.g., `seo_missing_title`, `security_api_key_in_url`). The `plugin` column is added to distinguish plugin issues from scanner issues:

```sql
-- Add to issues table
alter table issues add column plugin text;  -- null for scanner issues, plugin name for plugin issues
alter table issues add column severity text default 'error';  -- error | warning | info
```

| Content quality score | **AI** — summarize page, score readability and keyword relevance | Yes | info |

## 16.2 Security Check Plugin

Checks HTTP headers, HTML content, network traffic, and cookies for security issues.

| Check | Method | AI? | Severity |
|-------|--------|-----|----------|
| Missing HTTPS | Check page URL scheme | No | error |
| Missing `Content-Security-Policy` header | HTTP response headers | No | warning |
| Missing `Strict-Transport-Security` header | HTTP response headers | No | warning |
| Missing `X-Frame-Options` header | HTTP response headers | No | warning |
| Missing `X-Content-Type-Options` header | HTTP response headers | No | warning |
| Missing `Referrer-Policy` header | HTTP response headers | No | info |
| Mixed content (HTTP resources on HTTPS page) | Scan HTML for `http://` in src/href attributes | No | error |
| Forms without CSRF tokens | Check form hidden fields for `csrf`/`_token`/`authenticity_token` | No | warning |
| Forms submitting over HTTP | Check form `action` attribute starts with `http://` | No | error |
| Cookies without `Secure` flag | Read cookies via `page.cookies()` | No | warning |
| Cookies without `HttpOnly` flag | Read cookies via `page.cookies()` | No | warning |
| Cookies without `SameSite` flag | Read cookies via `page.cookies()` | No | info |
| **API keys in network URLs** | Scan all captured network request URLs for patterns: `api_key=`, `apikey=`, `key=`, `token=`, `secret=`, `password=`, `Authorization` in query strings | No | error |
| **API keys in request headers** | Scan network request headers for `Authorization: Bearer` tokens, API keys sent as custom headers | No | error |
| **Sensitive data in network responses** | Scan response bodies for patterns matching API keys, tokens, passwords, private keys (regex: `/[A-Za-z0-9_-]{32,}/`, known key prefixes like `sk_live_`, `pk_test_`, `AKIA`) | No | error |
| Exposed sensitive info in HTML source | Regex scan for API keys, tokens, passwords in HTML comments and inline scripts | No | error |
| Open redirect potential | Check if any redirect URLs accept user-controlled input | No | warning |
| SQL injection/XSS vectors | **AI** — analyze form fields, suggest attack patterns to test | Yes | info |

**Network traffic analysis** runs against all `NetworkLogEntry` records captured during scanning. For each request:
1. Parse URL query parameters — flag any parameter name matching sensitive patterns
2. Parse request headers — flag `Authorization`, `X-Api-Key`, custom token headers sent to third-party domains
3. For same-domain API responses: check if response body contains key-like strings that shouldn't be exposed to the browser

## 16.3 Content Check Plugin

Analyzes visible text content across all pages. Mix of deterministic and AI-powered checks.

| Check | Method | AI? | Severity |
|-------|--------|-----|----------|
| Placeholder content ("Lorem ipsum", "TODO", "Coming soon", "TBD") | Regex pattern matching on visible text | No | error |
| Broken external links | HTTP HEAD request to each external href | No | warning |
| Readability score (Flesch-Kincaid) | Deterministic formula on visible text (syllables, words, sentences) | No | info |
| Copyright year outdated | Regex for `© 20XX` in footer, compare to current year | No | warning |
| Empty pages (no meaningful content) | Check if visible text < 50 chars | No | error |
| Spelling errors | **AI** — check visible text for misspellings | Yes | warning |
| Grammar issues | **AI** — check text for grammar problems | Yes | info |
| Inconsistent terminology | **AI** — compare terms across all pages (e.g., "Sign In" vs "Log In", "Cart" vs "Basket") | Yes | warning |
| Inappropriate/offensive content | **AI** — content moderation scan | Yes | error |
| Alt text quality (meaningful, not just "image" or "photo") | **AI** — evaluate whether alt text describes the image purpose | Yes | info |

## 16.4 UI Consistency Check Plugin

Compares visual styles **across all pages** to ensure consistent design language.

**Cross-page style extraction:** For each page state, extract computed styles for key element categories via `page.evaluate()`:

```ts
// Elements to check for consistency across pages
const STYLE_TARGETS = {
  headings: { selectors: ['h1', 'h2', 'h3'], props: ['fontFamily', 'fontSize', 'fontWeight', 'color', 'lineHeight'] },
  bodyText: { selectors: ['p', 'li', 'span'], props: ['fontFamily', 'fontSize', 'color', 'lineHeight'] },
  buttons: { selectors: ['button', '[role="button"]', 'input[type="submit"]'], props: ['fontFamily', 'fontSize', 'fontWeight', 'color', 'backgroundColor', 'borderRadius', 'padding', 'height'] },
  links: { selectors: ['a'], props: ['fontFamily', 'fontSize', 'color', 'textDecoration'] },
  inputs: { selectors: ['input[type="text"]', 'input[type="email"]', 'textarea'], props: ['fontFamily', 'fontSize', 'borderColor', 'borderRadius', 'padding', 'height'] },
};
```

**Consistency checks (all deterministic):**

| Check | Method | AI? | Severity |
|-------|--------|-----|----------|
| **Heading font inconsistency** | Compare `h1` fontFamily/fontSize across all pages. Flag if >1 distinct style | No | warning |
| **Body text font inconsistency** | Compare `p` fontFamily/fontSize across pages | No | warning |
| **Button style inconsistency** | Compare button backgroundColor/borderRadius/fontSize/padding across pages. Flag if >2 distinct button styles | No | warning |
| **Button size inconsistency** | Compare button height/padding across pages | No | warning |
| **Link color inconsistency** | Compare `a` color across pages | No | warning |
| **Input field style inconsistency** | Compare input border/padding/fontSize across pages | No | warning |
| **Color palette outliers** | Extract all used colors, build a palette, flag colors used on only 1 page | No | info |
| **Inconsistent spacing** | Compare padding/margin on similar containers across pages | No | info |
| Text overflow / truncation | Check if `scrollWidth > clientWidth` on text elements | No | warning |
| Missing focus styles | Tab through interactive elements, check if `:focus` changes outline/border | No | warning |
| Overlapping elements | Check bounding box intersections between visible elements | No | error |
| **Visual regression desktop vs. mobile** | **AI** — compare desktop and mobile screenshots of same page for layout breaks | Yes | warning |

**Cross-page comparison algorithm:**
1. For each style target category (headings, buttons, etc.), collect computed styles from every page state
2. Group by the computed style values → identify the "majority style" (most pages agree)
3. Flag pages that deviate from the majority style, listing the specific property that differs
4. Example output: "Button on /checkout uses backgroundColor #FF0000, but 8/10 pages use #2563EB"

# 18. Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Action-driven scanning | Exhaustive: every element gets mouseover then click. Discovers all states deterministically |
| Mouse-first, then inputs | Discover all pages/states before filling forms. AI needs full site context to generate good personas |
| AI for personas + input values, not navigation | AI understands meaning; code handles exhaustive traversal |
| Pairwise testing for controls | Covers all 2-way interactions without combinatorial explosion |
| Separate test cases per Persona | Same form tested with different user contexts produces different behavior |
| Scan per SizeClass | Desktop and mobile may have different elements, layouts, and navigation |
| Test across Screen resolutions | Within a SizeClass, test cases run at multiple common viewport sizes |
| Login detection via redirect + HTTP status | Covers both server-rendered (redirect) and API-driven (401/403) auth patterns |
| Puppeteer over Playwright | Node.js native, lighter, direct CDP control |
| Local Chromium over cloud browser | Simpler, free, no vendor dependency |
| Template-based test generation | Deterministic, fast, cheap — AI adds no value for code generation |
| JSON action sequences over generated code | Portable, easy to validate, no string-based code generation |
| Normalized DB over JSONB blobs | Queryable, indexable, proper foreign keys |
| Single Node.js runtime | One language, one deployment, one toolchain |
| Persistent browser profile | Session reuse, manual login bootstrap |
| Plugin architecture for add-ons | SEO, security, content, UI consistency checks run as opt-in plugins after scanning |
| Project → Entity integration | Projects belong to entities (from entity_service), enabling multi-tenant organization support |
| Three-level time tracking | Wall-clock (total run), per-phase, and per-action durations for full observability |
| Test Run per execution | Each Test Case × Screen creates a Test Run record, enabling per-execution issue tracking |
| AI token tracking | Every OpenAI call records prompt/completion tokens for cost visibility |
| Hono over Fastify | Existing testomniac_api uses Hono — no migration needed |
| Separate scanner service | Scanner polls DB for pending runs. Decoupled from API. Independent scaling |
| PostgreSQL LISTEN/NOTIFY for SSE | No Redis needed. Built-in pub/sub for real-time scan progress |
| Encrypted credentials | AES-256-GCM in separate table, deleted after scan completes |
| React Flow for Map | Flowchart-style site map with dagre auto-layout, side panel for page detail |
| TanStack Table for lists | Test Cases, Test Runs, Issues need filtering/sorting/pagination |
| Full mobile parity | All 11 pages available on both web and React Native |
| SSE on both platforms | Web uses native EventSource, React Native uses polyfill |
